## What is it?
Wthr is a simple Firefox OS app. It uses HTML5 geolocation to get the device current location, queries [World Weather Online APIs](http://worldweatheronline.com/free-weather-feed.aspx) for weather informations and change the background color of the app accordingly (the color ranges from dark orange for a high temperature to dark blue for cold one), it also changes the weather icon ([Climacons](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/font/)) based on the weather description.




## How to Install 

Go to [wthr.feras.us](http://wthr.feras.us) on your Firefox OS browser and the install dialog will appear.
